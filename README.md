# FlashCard-App

Created with React.js and Bootstrap.

This application allows a user to create decks of custom flashcards. Use separate decks for different subjects or difficulty levels. Cards are unique to each deck, have both a front and back side, and can be edited at any time. Review these cards later to learn and retain information.
